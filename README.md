# 🏀 NBA Player Statistics Analysis 🏀

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involves analyzing NBA player statistics to gain insights into player performance, team comparisons, and overall league trends. The dataset is processed using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains various attributes related to NBA players' performances, including:

### **Features:**

- **Numerical Features:** Points per game (PPG), Assists per game (APG), Rebounds per game (RPG), Steals per game (SPG), Blocks per game (BPG), Turnovers (TO), Field Goal Percentage (FG%), Free Throw Percentage (FT%), Three-Point Percentage (3P%).
- **Categorical Features:** Player Name, Team, Position, Season.

## 🔍 Implementation Details

### **Steps Involved**

1. **Load the dataset**: The dataset is loaded using Pandas for analysis.
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values and inconsistent data entries.
   - Convert categorical data into appropriate formats for analysis.
   - Normalize numerical features for better visual representation.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize player performance trends over multiple seasons.
   - Compare team statistics and identify key players.
   - Identify correlations between different statistical metrics.
4. **Statistical Analysis & Insights**:
   - Calculate mean, median, and standard deviations for key metrics.
   - Identify top performers in different statistical categories.
   - Analyze team strengths and weaknesses based on player statistics.
5. **Visualization**:
   - Generate various types of charts and graphs using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
   - Create interactive dashboards using Power BI for better insights.

## 📊 Visualization Types Used

The following types of visualizations have been used in the project:

- **Bar Charts:** Used for comparing player statistics such as PPG, APG, and RPG.
- **Scatter Plots:** Used for identifying trends and correlations between key metrics.
- **Heatmaps:** Used to visualize correlations between numerical features.
- **Pie Charts:** Used for distribution analysis of categorical attributes like player positions.
- **Line Charts:** Used to show trends over multiple seasons.
- **Box Plots:** Used to analyze the spread and distribution of player statistics.
- **Power BI Interactive Dashboards:** Provide dynamic insights with filtering options.
